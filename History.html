            <h2 id="first">First settlers</h2>
            <p>The ancestors of the Aboreans began arriving at the island around 65,000 to 50,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. The oldest human remains found on Arbor are around 40,000 years old. It is assumed that it was discovered at the same time as Australia was discovered, and the children of the people who settled in Australia were the ones who settled in Arbor. Like Australia and many other Oceania countries, Australia maintains some of the longest-known traditions and cultures. Before the British colonization of Arbor, it is believed it was home to 100,000 Arboreans, who were hunters due to the island's large number of animals and gatherers due to the large number of edible fruits and other plants that are on the island. Unfortunately, it is believed that many exotic animals, fruits, vegetables, and plants went extinct during the time Arbor was colonized due to the mass export of natural goods. 

                The Arboreans had made contact in the 17th and 18th centuries with other people who lived in the different Oceania countries, but it is believed they had no influence on the Arborian culture. 
            </p>
            <h2 id="colonies"> European colonization and exploration</h2>
            <p>It is believed that the first people who discovered Arbor were the Dutch. On February 26, 1606, Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon stepped on the land of Australia. When he came back to Europe, he spread word about the discovery of Australia, but also about another island, presumably Arbor, which they didn’t explore nor make their way to due to their lack of resources, time, and uncertainty about how friendly the Arboreans would be. The same year, Spanish explorer Luis Vaz de Torres navigated the Torres Strait Islands and also caught sight of Arbor, yet like Willem Janszoon, he decided not to explore Arbor. However, in 1770, Captain James Cook sailed and mapped the east coast of Australia and the west coast of Arbor, which he claimed for Great Britain. When the First Fleet of British Ships arrived at Port Jackson, Australia, several colonies were made in many of the Oceania countries. 

                On March 8, 1828, a separate colony arrived in Arbor. The Arborean people didn't, however, want a colony in their country, and so a war occurred on April 4, 1828, between the Arboreans and the British. It lasted four months, because that’s how long it took for the British colonizers to leave, return to Great Britain, and come back. The Arborean people were attacked by surprise on the 4th of April at 2:30 in the morning when it was still dark, which caused the British to run away. They sailed back to Great Britain, arriving on the 12th of June. On the 19th of June, they sailed out back to Arbor with a small fleet of warships, a large number of soldiers, and a lot better prepared for any attack from the Arboreans. When they arrived on the 18th of August, the Arboreans tried to fight them off, but after several minutes, they were forced to retreat due to how much more powerful the British people were. On the 20th of August, the entirety of Arbor was controlled by the British Empire, which enslaved the Arboreans and made several colonies. 
                
                Arbor gained independence in 1907. After many Oceania countries that were colonized gained independence, the Arboreans made negotiations with the British, which resulted in the British leaving Arbor.

            <h2 id="rebuilding"> Rebuilding Arbor and the World Wars</h2>
            <p>
                After gaining independence, Arbor was in a weakened state due to the British influence on the country. Luckily for them, several Oceania countries that also just gained independence were willing to help one another in exchange for help back. Arbor traded goods with other countries, learned new technologies, made their own army, set up a proper government, and became a lot more industrialized. 

Thanks to how quickly Arbor was rebuilt and how quickly they were equal to other countries, they were able to take part in the first World War. They followed in Australia’s footsteps, joining the allies, just like Australia took part in many major battles on the Western front. Arbor had a population of around 2,073,000 people in 1914, and around 165,900 Arboreans served in the First World War. Of the 165,900 Arboreans that served, around 22,000 were killed and 49,000 were injured. 

Arbor also took part in the second World War, once again joining the allies just like Australia. Due to the defeat of Great Britain in Asia and the bombing of Darwin (a Japanese air raid on Australia in 1942), Australia believed a Japanese air raid was imminent. Australia changed its security partner and principal ally to the United States (previously Great Britain). Arbor knew that if a Japanese invasion were to occur in Australia, they would likely be affected by it too, so to play it safe, they also changed their security partner and principal ally to the United States.

            <h2 id="afterwar">Arbor after the war</h2>
            <p>
                After the war, there was a large increase in living standards and country development in Arbor. Unlike their close neighbors in Australia, Arbor did not participate in the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency, or the Vietnam War. Instead, they had decided to spend their time further developing their country and overall making it better. They made more business deals with other countries, exporting more exotic goods, mainly fruits such as breadfruit, quandong, and gala apples. 

Because Arbor didn’t participate in the war, a lot more tourists began visiting the country, fascinated by its large variety of cultures, traditions, and wildlife. One of the most popular tourist attractions to this day is diving near the coral reefs in the ocean surrounding Arbor. 

In 1990, Arbor became a republic, after 63% of voters preferred to stop being a monarch and become a republic. 

After the 9/11 attacks, despite some plans, Arbor did not participate in the Afghanistan war from 2001 to 2021 or in the Iraq war from 2003 to 2009, unlike their close neighbor, Australia.
