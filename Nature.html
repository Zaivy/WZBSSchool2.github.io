            <h2 id="LandA">Land animals</h2>
            <p>
                Talking about the rare and exotic animals, another reason for why Arbor is well known and popular with tourists is due to the large variety in animals that can be found in very few places. Arbor, like other countries in Oceania has the highest concentration of marsupials, animals that carry their young in their pouch, such as kangaroos, koalas and wombats. A large amount of monotremes live in this area too, such as the platypus and echidna.

            <h2 id="Birds">Birds</h2>
            <p>
                Not only exotic land animals live in Arbor, though. Thanks to the tropical weather, many birds find Arbor suitable. These are mainly parrots and other colorful birds, but flightless birds are also inhabitants of Arbor. 

On Arbor, we can find emus, large birds that have powerful legs that allow them to run as fast as 50 kilometers per hour. We can find cassowaries, birds that are related to emus, and just like emus, they are capable of killing a human. 

Lastly, we can also find small, nocturnal brown kiwi birds that measure around 14–18 inches and lay eggs that are one of the biggest in the world. Kiwi bird eggs are six times as big as chicken eggs, almost as big as emu and ostrich eggs, and for those curious, this is actually terrible for the kiwi birds. Overall, Kiwi birds have a tough time. They are very small, although they are related to the biggest birds on the planet, such as ostriches, emus, and cassowaries. They are also flightless. As someone said, kiwi birds are pretty much as defenseless as the fruit kiwi. And about the egg, it’s the only thing about them that isn’t small. The eggs are so big for the Kiwi bird that it weighs 20% of its body weight, rearranges its organs, and stretches out its rib cage.

            <h2 id="SeaAnim">Sea animals</h2>
            <p>
                A very large sea animal we can find around Arbor, but actually all around the southern hemisphere, is the blue whale. The blue whale is the largest animal ever found (for now, because around 80% of the ocean hasn’t yet been discovered, so we might find an even larger animal), growing as large as 29,9 meters long, or around 98 feet, which is as long as the longest bus ever that can fit 256 passengers (for those curious, the bus is called Autotram Extra Grand). 

Another animal we can find in Arbor and all around the Oceania region is the saltwater crocodile. The saltwater crocodile is the largest reptile alive, weighing a ton and reaching 23 feet long. The saltwater crocodile also has the largest bite force in the world. 

We can also find the elephant seal, which can weigh 8,800 pounds and reach 20 feet. 

But the most fascinating and mysterious yet scary sea animal around Arbor and the Oceania region has to be the giant squid. You might be scared of the blue whale; however, there hasn’t been a single recorded case of a blue whale eating a human, even partially. They won’t even try to eat small sea mammals. Not only do blue whales have no teeth, but their throat is only one foot wide, meaning there is no way they could swallow a human whole. Blue whales could be described as the gentle giants of the sea. However, giant squids can grow up to 40 feet long. They are predators with 20-foot-long tentacles and also cannibals. Now, giant squids have a donut-shaped brain that is around their throat, meaning if they were to choke on something too big, they could get brain damage. That’s why they shred their victims with a razor-sharp beak and the radula, which is a tongue with teeth. Giant squids are often hunted by different predators, such as the sperm whale, which can grow up to twice as large as the giant squid, 80 feet, or 24 meters. Despite the fact that the sperm whale is twice as large, weighs several times more, and usually wins in a fight against the giant squid, it’s rare that a sperm whale will be found that hasn’t been scarred or injured by a giant squid. Another frightening thing about the giant squid is its huge eye, which can be as big as a soccer ball. Now I did call the giant squid a fascinating and mysterious yet scary creature. Well, the reason why is because the giant squid was caught alive only in 2012, despite its giant size. Most of what we know about giant squids is because of the dead bodies found on shore or by fishermen. But due to how deep underwater they live and how elusive they are, we really don’t know a lot about them. Now, there hasn’t been a documented casualty caused by the giant squid. There have been a lot of reported cases, however, of giant squid attacking ships. The most well-known one is probably the attack of a giant squid on USS Stein, a United States destroyer escort and frigate. In 1978, over 8% of the dome of the ship had been scratched and cut by an apparently unknown species of giant squid. Nearly all of those cuts contained fragments of the sharp, curved claws found on the rims of the suction cups of some squid tentacles. The claws were much larger than those of any squid that had been discovered at that time.

            <h2 id="MostDang">Most dangerous animals in Arbor</h2>
            <p>
                Now we know some of you readers are interested in the dangers that can lurk in Arbor. Wildlife attacks are rare; however, it's important that tourists know about these potential dangers just in case. You know how the saying goes: better safe than sorry. 

Like previously mentioned, cassowaries can kill humans. They have been called the “world’s most dangerous bird” by some for a reason. But these large birds only killed two humans, one in 1926 and one in 2019. 

But another large animal that can be deadly is the Komodo dragon. In a 38-year period (from 1974 to 2012), the Komodo dragon attacked humans twenty-four times, and five of those attacks were fatal. What makes the Komodo dragon so dangerous, though? Well, the Komodo dragon can reach up to 3 meters in length (9.8 feet) and weigh up to 70kg (150 pounds). The Komodo dragon can also swim and run 18–20 kilometers per hour, while the average human can only run around 12 kilometers per hour. The Komodo dragon is also lethally armed. Not only are the Komodo dragon’s teeth very sharp so that they can rip and tear through their prey, but the Komodo dragon also has venom. This venom is strong enough to take down an animal like a water buffalo. This venom reduces the victim’s blood clotting, which makes it more likely for the victim to bleed out. The venom also lowers blood pressure and causes shock and muscle paralysis. Now the problem with muscle paralysis is that the victim doesn’t have to be dead for the Komodo dragon to start its meal. And would a Komodo dragon eat a paralyzed but alive human? I’d say yes, because not only do Komodo dragons eat their prey alive if it hasn’t died yet, but they have also been known for digging out human corpses out of graves and eating whatever remains they could find. And if it’s speed, ability to swim, teeth, and venom weren’t enough, they have a great sense of smell. They can smell carrion from 5 to 10 kilometers away. There isn’t any animal that is safe from the Komodo dragon. Not even another Komodo dragon. Komodo dragon hatchlings will spend most of their lives in the trees before they grow up, because adult Komodo dragons have been known to eat Komodo hatchlings, even if those hatchlings are their own children. 

However, it’s not like just big animals like the cassowary and the Komodo dragon can be lethal. Small animals can also be just as, if not more, lethal and dangerous to humans. 

The blue-ringed octopus can be found in the ocean surrounding Arbor. These octopuses have been known to kill only three people. A small amount, but that doesn’t change how deadly their venom can be. The toxin all blue-ringed octopuses contain is tetrodotoxin (TTX), and all it takes to kill a human is 1-2 milligrams. The blue-ringed octopus usually injects enough venom to kill 26 humans. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the sting is usually small and painless, meaning you won’t probably even realize you have been stung by this octopus until the symptoms start to kick in. The symptoms are trouble with breathing and moving, and you better not be somewhere far in the water when the sting happens, because becoming paralyzed and drowning is a terrible way to go. 

And probably the scariest animal on this list is the Sydney funnel web spider. They have been brought to Arbor by Australians, and now, on rare occasions, they can be found in Arbor. The Sydney funnel web spider has 13 reported deaths, and around 30 to 40 bites occur each year. Luckily, since anti-venoms have become available, nobody died in the 1980s, but that doesn’t mean that their bite can’t kill you if you ignore the bite and any symptoms such as pain, nausea, vomiting, feeling sick, and sweating. 

And the last dangerous sea animal is the lionfish. The lionfish is an invasive species, and lab studies show that other animals in the sea would prefer to starve than eat the lionfish. Why? The lionfish is venomous. If you were to get injected with the venom (Pterois), there are a lot of different symptoms that could occur, but the most dangerous and noticeable are temporary paralysis of the limbs, respiratory insufficiency, heart failure, convulsions, and even death. You can also have allergic reactions to the pterios venom, such as chest pain, severe breathing difficulties, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the tongue, sweating, or slurred speech. If untreated, this could also result in death.

            <h2 id="Endangered">Endangered animals in Arbor</h2>
            <p>
                Arbor, due to its large biodiversity and different areas, is home to many tropical, rare, and exotic animals. But because of that, during the British colonization period, a lot of these animals were hunted so much that they barely avoided extinction and shared the same fate as the dodo bird. To this day, a lot of these animals, despite the desperate efforts, haven’t been able to repopulate very well. However, thanks to new laws, restrictions (such as jail time for hunting and killing endangered animals), spreading awareness and help from humans, these animals are clearly doing well despite their endangered status. 

One of these animals is the tree kangaroo. Due to how much they were hunted, to this day, they are threatened with extinction. Not only that, people still hunt tree kangaroos today, and they are also losing their houses due to habitat loss. I mean, their name is literally the tree kangaroos. They live at the top of trees, even 1220 meters above sea level. Because of deforestation, their houses are unfortunately being replaced with logging and timber, coffee, wheat, and rice production. Humans kill tree kangaroos too, either by driving into them on the road or by human dogs killing tree kangaroos. 

Pademelons are small macropods (plant-eating marsupial animals that come from kangaroos and wallabies) that can grow up to 60 cm and weigh up to 7kg. They can be found in Arbor, but also in New Guinea and Tasmania. The first settlers, indigenous Australians, and Arboreans considered pademelon meat valuable and hunted it. The hunting of the pademelons only increased when the British arrived, and they also began hunting the pademelons. Pademelons were also hunted and killed for their soft fur. After the pademelons were given endangered status, they were still being hunted. Not by humans, but by both native and non-native predators such as quolls, cats, dogs, and red foxes. They also had their living habitat decreased when the rabbit population in Australia grew unexpectedly and some of those rabbits made their way to Arbor, probably by hiding on ships or being illegally smuggled. These rabbits repopulated quickly, and many grass areas are filled with rabbits, meaning there is less for these pademelons. And as if that wasn’t enough, due to the clearing of land for urbanization, larger wallabies moved into the areas in which the pademelons lived without much competition. Luckily, there are habitats in nature that are controlled by humans, making sure these habitats are not invaded by other predators or rabbits, allowing the pademelons to live in large numbers in these areas. 

And lastly, we have an animal that is really rare, despite being the largest of its species. We are talking about Queen Alexandra’s birdwing butterfly. Growing up to 28 cm, this butterfly is the largest one in the world. It can only be found in New Guinea and Arbor, and even there, it is a rare sight to see. The reason this butterfly is so rare is because of oil palm plantations. Due to an eruption of Mount Lamington in New Guinea in the 1950s, which caused the destruction of a large part of this species's living area and is one of the reasons for its rarity today, attempts were made to try and give these butterflies a new home in the rainforests in south-west Arbor. The process was a success, with a small number of Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing butterflies living in Arbor. However, even butterflies are hunted today. They are caught by collectors, since on the black market, people interested in buying these rare butterflies are willing to pay even 10,000 dollars for them. People were caught trying to catch and smuggle these butterflies. In 2001, renowned Canadian researcher Gilles Leslisle was fined 50,000 Canadian dollars for illegally importing six Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing butterflies. In 2007, Hisayoshi Kojima, called by some the “world’s most notorious butterfly smuggler” and the “global butterfly smuggler,” was caught and pleaded guilty to seventeen charges after selling a number of endangered species, including a pair of Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing butterflies priced at 8,500 dollars, to a special agent with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. People who illegally collected these butterflies would even shoot them down with small shotguns. Luckily, today it is hard to catch and sell these rare butterflies.

            <h2 id="Extinct">Extinct animals that were once in Arbor</h2>
            <p>
                Due to how many animals were hunted, there are a lot of animals that used to reside on Arbor, yet today you can only see their skeletons or stuffed corpses in museums. For decades, several organizations have tried to prevent the extinction of many animals. However, not all species could be rescued, and for some, help simply came too late. 

                This brings us to our first animal, the Australian Tasmanian Tiger. They could grow to 60 cm in height and a meter in length. They were brought to Arbor by Australians to give them a new home, but they still went extinct. There were three reasons why the Australian Tasmanian Tiger went extinct. First of all, they were seen as a threat to livestock by the farmers who lived on Arbor. Secondly, bounty hunting grew in popularity, and the Australian Tasmanian Tiger wasn’t the hardest prey to catch. People were willing to do it for sport, for money, or out of fear. And fear brings us to the third reason. When the British colonizers arrived in Oceania, they were puzzled by these animals. They feared them too, so if they had an opportunity, they would kill an Australian Tasmanian Tiger. Due to how powerful the British empire was at the time and the fact that they were controlling the entire island, it was hard for these animals to safely wander out anywhere during the day or to even live anywhere near any human. Also, despite the Tasmanian tiger’s impressive jaw, being able to open up to 80 degrees and having even 46 teeth, the tiger's jaw was apparently too weak to even kill a sheep. Meaning, it wasn’t really a threat to the farmer’s livestock on Arbor, yet due to the fear that it could potentially kill and eat their livestock, they were killed and hunted down. Even though help did come, unfortunately, the Australian Tasmanian tiger couldn’t be saved. The last of its species died unfortunately in Tasmania, Hobart Zoo, in 1936. However, to this day, the family of the Tasmanian Tiger, the Thylacine, is widely spread in Australian and Arborian cultures and a popular icon. I think it would be pretty interesting to mention that there are many reported sightings of the Tasmanian Tiger, but no official sighting has been confirmed. The possibility of a Tasmanian Tiger still existing is discussed, though. 
                
                One of the more recent extinctions is the extinction of the Bramble Cay melomys. They also hold the title of the first known mammal wiped out by human-induced climate change. How did that happen? We’ll get to that in a bit. Let’s first tell you about the animal and not about the crimes of humanity towards nature. The Bramble Cay melomys were small, brown rodents that were part of the Muridae family (the largest family of rodents and mammals) and the subfamily Murinae (part of the Muridae family containing 519 different species). They were around 14.5–18.5 cm in tail length and around 14.5–16.5 cm in length. For a rodent, that was pretty large. Bramble Cay melomys also had a long tail, short ears, and large feet. They lived in Arbor due to the large number of coral reefs. They lived on vegetated coral cays that were above sea level. Now humans have killed these little rodents by raising the sea level. This destroyed their habitats and drowned them. There were attempts to save them, however. In 2008, the Queensland Government’s Environmental Protection Agency published a recovery plan for the Bramble Cay melomys. They began monitoring them, searching for them, and raising public awareness about these endangered rodents. The last reported sighting of them was in 2009. Surveys failed to find the Bramble Cay melomy in 2011. In 2014, scientists found no traces of these rodents. A search and capture was conducted to save them by starting a breeding captive program. After taking 5 months to get all necessary permissions, in 2015, it was too late; not a single melomy could be found. In June 2016, the Bramble Cay melomys were said to be extinct by the Queensland Government’s Environmental Protection Agency. On February 18, 2019, the Australian and Arborian governments officially recognized the extinction of the Bramble Cay melomy. 
                
                A unique frog that went extinct was the gastric-brooding frog. Why were they unique? These dark, usually light brown frogs with bumpy skin and a slimy mucus coating were known for their habit of gestating the young in the mother’s stomach. Only one other frog species is known to do this (the Darwin Frog). For those curious, basically after laying the eggs or embryos, the mother frog would swallow them. They had a small habitat of 770 square meters in other countries, with a small habitat of 230 square meters in Arbor. They ate caddisfly larvae and aquatic beetles, and they were theoretically cannibals since they ate other frogs. They also had a yellow underside, and the northern gastric-brooding frogs were larger. The cause of the extinction of the gastric-brooding frog is probably the human introduction of pathogenic fungi into their native habitats. Despite logging activities in their native areas, it is believed these weren’t the cause of extinction because the gastric-brooding frogs were reported to still be living in the streams near the places that were being logged in 1972–1979. Another reason for their extinction could be that the areas they inhabitated back then are now threatened by feral pigs, the invasion of weed, altered flow, and water quality problems caused by uptream disturbance. In summary, the gastric-brooding frogs most likely went extinct due to habitat loss, creek change and pollution, and, lastly, disease and fungi. They haven’t been seen since the 1980s (for those curious, it’s more exactly 1976–1981, depending on the source), and there is no indication they are still alive in the wild. However, Australian scientists are trying to bring them back using the process of cloning gastric-brooding frog cells, so perhaps one day we’ll see them again in the forests of Australia, Arbor, and other Oceania countries.
