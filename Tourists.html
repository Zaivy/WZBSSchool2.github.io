                Arbor has over 5,000 caves with paintings in them dating back to even 35,000 years ago. Due to the large amount of tools, skeletons, and other old objects, Arbor has many museums, some even free for both tourists and locals to visit, be guided by a historian or trained guide, and even learn some skills that Arboreans used centuries ago. These museums can be large buildings made by the Arborian government, but there are also many villages, some as old as 4,000 years old, that serve as museums for us to visit. 

The most popular art styles in Arbor are wood carving and tree sculpting. On a piece of wood, or just straight up on an entire unlucky tree that was cut down, the Arboreans carefully and precisely carve through and chip away the wood to create whatever is on their mind. Every year there is an art show, primarily showcasing the wood sculptures and the art carved in the wood. Usually, it happens on the last day of spring.

            <h2 id="Traditions">Traditions</h2>
            <p>
                There are many traditions that occur in Arbor that aren’t just Christmas or New Year’s Eve. One of them is similar to America’s Independence Day. Arbor gained independence from the British Empire and colonies in 1907, but more exactly on the 26th of March. On that day each year, it is known for the Arboreans to have parades and celebrations throughout the day and donate to the poor and homeless in the manner of helping others out, like how after gaining independence, other countries on the Oceania continent were willing to help Arbor rebuild themselves. At the end of the day, the Arboreans gather their entire families and eat together a dinner, with the main course being pork chops from pigs and national dishes. We will talk more about national dishes in the “Arborian national cuisine” section for those who are curious or perhaps just want to try some themselves. 

Another tradition that the Arboreans celebrate each year is the rebellion against the British that happened on April 4, 1828. If you missed it and wanted to read more about it, we talked about it in the “History” section. On this day, there are multiple parades once more, but instead of being a cheerful celebration, this is more of a mourning day and reminder. All around cities, towns, and villages, a large arborian flag is displayed, usually even up to 100–200 meters long, held by a large group of people by the edges in the center of the city, town, or village. Since the rebellion happened by surprise when it was dark early in the morning, scouts and other organizations often go to their local cemetery at 2:30 AM, where they spend a while, usually an hour, standing in silence in honor and rememberance of the brave uprising of the Arboreans almost two centuries ago. 

On the 18th–20th of August, the day the British returned to Arbor in 1828, and throughout the three-day period decimated and defeated any group of resilience or rebellion, the Arboreans could not eat on the 18th; they had to do something productive, do some hard labor in their gardens or other places on the 19th, and on the 20th at night at the local cemetery, there was usually a group meeting where the Arboreans sang some songs, talked, and went back home before midnight.

                In 1907, the Arboreans began creating entertainment for one another. Now, with much more free time and no censorship that was enforced by the British during their 79-year-long ruling period, and with tools, technology, help, and knowledge that the Arboreans simply didn’t have before, they began experimenting. 

The first feature-length narrative movie was called “We Say to the British No!” and was created in 1913. (Name changed since the Arboreans were not happy with what the British did, and the original movie title was explicit and was changed here to make this website family-friendly.) It was a patriotic film about the struggles and fights of the Arboreans against the British, showcasing the cruelty and lack of remorse the British people had for the Arboreans. The movie is shown for free in many museums for audiences that are old enough to watch it. The movie has explicit language and uses real corpses as props, which is why it is called very realistic in terms of graphical performance despite being poorly made and having low quality due to how poor the filming equipment was back then. 

The highest-rated Arborian movie was called “Throughout Land and Water." (2011) The plot is about an undercover agent, Charlie Bell, who was caught red-handed by the criminals he was spying on by being an informant for the police force. The criminals illegally smuggled rare and exotic animals, and due to the lack of evidence, our hero, Charlie Bell, played by George Rush, was tasked with collecting evidence. However, after being caught, Bell realizes that this isn’t just a small group of outlaws that were making a living by crime; he learns that there is much more to the case than what he and the police force thought at first. Making heartbreaking decisions and sacrifices and facing the consequences of his actions with each step Charlie takes, the film was loved by both critics and audiences all around the world. It has been loved for its stunning views of the Arborian beaches, coral reefs, and ocean surrounding it, for the realistic scenes and actually good, well-done CGI effects, as well as the characters that the viewers actually care for and aren’t forgettable or made just to have a pointless death. The movie was also made to spread awareness about the illegal black market of animals, and a small percentage of the film’s earnings were donated to organizations that protected wildlife and stopped the illegal buying and selling of these exotic animals. The film ended up winning the OFCS award, and George Rush was awarded an Emmy Award for his performance. A sequel is being made, with many fans questioning if this is a good decision. The film simply doesn’t need a sequel, but perhaps we will be surprised. Maybe it will be a sequel that is called by many better than the original, a movie like Terminator 2: Judgement Day. 

Other than movies, national Arborian television has two public broadcasters (the Arborian Broadcasting Corporation and the Amazing, True Arborian Television, called the AT-AT), six commercial television networks, and many public, non-profit television and radio station channels. Arbor also has numerous national pay-TV services (not counting pay-TV services from other countries in Arbor). Every major city has its own free radio station and news network, as well as a cheap newspaper. There are two national newspapers (The Arborian Neighbour and The Arborian Newspaper Boy). In 2020, “Reporters without Borders" placed Arbor 29th on a list of 181 countries ranked by press freedom, behind other countries in Oceania like Australia (25th) and New Zealand (8th), but ahead of the United Kingdom (33rd) and the United States (44th).

            <h2 id="Arboriannc">Arborian national cuisine</h2>
            <p>
                Thanks to the diet of the first Arboreans on the island, for years the Arboreans have developed both sweet and sour recipes using the natural fruits that grow in Arbor. 

Wine is one of those products that the Arboreans have created for centuries and are known for. Since the war ended, the export of Arborian wine has greatly increased, and its popularity has grown all around the world. The most popular Arborian wine is made from Gala Apples, Lilly Pilly Fruits, and Native Raspberries. Except for wine, Arbor has a large beer consumption, with many major cities having numerous breweries. 

One of the most popular Arborian dishes is a cooked lobster called Ibacus peronii. The Ibacus peronii is also known as the Balmain bug and the butterfly fan lobster. It’s a species of slipper lobster, and the Balmain bug can reach up to 23cm (9 inches) in length and 14 cm (6 inches) in width. It’s a reddish-brown animal with no claws that lives in shallow waters around Arbor and other countries like Australia. It is caught so often that it is almost always available, especially in months like January and February. Only the tail of the butterfly fan lobster is edible and is often described as tasting like garlic. 

Another national dish is laplap. Some people wrongly spell it "laplap" or confuse it with "laplap," which is an item of clothing. Laplap is usually prepared by grating breadfruit into a vegetable paste, which, like previously mentioned, is an exotic fruit in Arbor and a few other countries. However, bananas, yam roots, and taro are used as substitutes or often mixed together with others. Next, the paste is wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in an underground stone oven with fresh coconut cream. Meats like pork, flying fox, beef, and chicken can be added. There are also a number of different variants, such as “Laplap Sosor," a variant of the national dish from the Malakula island. After cooking for three hours, it is best to eat it hot and as soon as possible. 

The last national Arborian dish we will be talking about on this list is paniki in yellow soup, which is a very unique dish. It’s... bats. Paniki is fruit bat meat mixed with spicy rica green chili pepper. When we were talking about Laplap, we said you can add meats like pork, flying fox, beef, and chicken. And no, flying fox meat is not meat from a fox that flies. It does, however, come from an animal that flies, and you probably already guessed what animal it is if we are talking about it here. Yes, it’s a bat. The black flying fox and red little flying fox are bats that are eaten in Oceania, usually by Australians and Arborians. In 1997, it was estimated that around 180,000 bats were eaten by just Australians each year. And this isn’t some new thing; bats have been hunted and eaten for approximately 74,000 years. In fact, many species of bats are endangered or close to extinction because they are hunted for food, medical reasons, and sport. Anyway, let’s get back to the dish. Before being eaten, bats caught are skinned, beheaded, and de-winged. Next up, they are gutted, chopped, and cooked or stewed. They can also be prepared in other ways, such as by being grilled, barbecued, or deep-fried. When deep-fried, the entire bat can apparently be cooked and eaten. Bat meat is usually seasoned with garlic, onions, and soy sauce. After the entire process, the bat meat is added to soup, but it can also be added to curries and stews. Since we are talking about fruit bat meat, it has been described as similar to the flavor of chicken. But it’s not as safe as chicken; there are a lot of issues with eating bats. First of all, overexplotation. Like we said before, certain species of bats are close to extinction or are endangered. We are going to talk a bit more about it now. Bats are most vulnerable to extinction in places like the Phillipines, Oceania, Indonesia, and a few more countries. Why? There are a few reasons. Bats naturally have a low rate of reproduction. Bats are highly colonial, which means it is easy to hunt them down in large numbers. And three, there are multiple reasons why a human would hunt them, which we mentioned before (food, medical reasons, and sports). Have any bats gone extinct due to overexplotation? Yes. Overhunting is believed to be the primary reason for the extinction of the small Maruitian flying fox and the Guam flying fox. The second issue is diseases. Due to the possible association with the Ebola infection, which killed over 10,000 people—to be exact, 11,310—and had a fatality rate of 40% in many West African countries, hunting, butchering, processing, and eating bat meat have been banned from 2013 to 2016. Today, several of the bans have been lifted. Also, a disease we all probably know, COVID-19, is suspected by many to have been caused by a bat or a person eating a bat. Now, is it confirmed? No, the answer as to what the origin of COVID-19 is is still unclear. It is, however, important to remember that the theory does lack a lot of evidence, so take it with a grain of salt.  

 

I will create a separate paragraph for the last issue, because, oh boy, you do not want to be affected by it, and it is pretty long. The last issue is the toxins that bat meat can contain. It has been found that bats consume large amounts of cycad seeds (which are highly poisonous for not only humans but also dogs, cattle, and sheep), and then the toxins accumulate to dangerous levels in bat meat. An example is that eating fruit bat meat has been linked to a neurological disease called Lytico-Bodis disease. The cause of the disease is often genetic, eating cycad seeds or eating fruit bats, which eat cycad seeds. Now, the disease is quite complicated and unique, so I suggest for those curious to look it up and read about it yourself to understand it better, but I’ll try to explain how terrible it is. The Lytico part of the disease can cause symptoms such as muscle atrophy (inability to move certain muscles), maxillofacial paralysis (paralysis of the face), the inability to speak or swallow, and subsequent choking. Except for physical symptoms, mental ones can occur too. Patients affected by the disease can experience mental lucidity until death. Mental lucidity is something that happens to people who have lost the ability to speak or communicate. It refers to a sudden return of consciousness, mental clarity, cognition, and memory. Unfortunately, it occurs shortly before death. If certain muscles become paralyzed, such as the respiratory ones, the person who is infected with the disease will have to be helped with breathing and must have their saliva suctioned from their mouth to prevent aspiration (basically suffocation, dying due to lack of air). Now the Bodig part of the disease affects the mentality of the infected person. Now it’s important to note that Bodig has no standard form, and every person can behave differently. However, usually progressive dementia is a symptom of Bodig, and those affected by dementia can appear restless, irrational, violent, and experience deep emotions. Their emotions can change with each passing minute. For example, they can be giggling and laughing, and in the very next minute, they are screaming at the top of their lungs. Now, physical symptoms can occur as well. Patients in the most virulent stage of the disease can be seen with mouths hanging wide open, experiencing excessive salvation, having motionless tongues, and being unable to speak or swallow. The limbs of patients can be spastic (spastic limbs mean unusually tight, stiff, or just straight-up paralyzed limbs) and bent in immovable tension (basically, the limbs are unable to move or the muscles of the affected limbs aren’t working properly). Patients in the most advanced state are usually motionless or in cataconia (a psychological problem that causes the affected person to experience increased or decreased movement, trouble with moving, being in unnatural positions, or being in one position for a long time), but people affected are also accompanied by tremors. And what’s the worst part about this entire disease? Like other certain diseases, such as the Kuru disease (you probably won’t get the Kuru disease unless you are a cannibal), the Lytico-Bodig disease is incurable. In some cases, giving the patient a drug called “L-DOPA” gave them freedom for an hour or two, but the paralysis comes back after that time period. Another bad thing, or good thing, depending on how you look at it, is that the Lytico part of the disease is fatal in all cases, while the Bodig part isn’t always fatal. But if you get it, I will be honest, you’ll probably hope you’ll die. 

Remember when I said bat meat is similar in flavor to chicken? Well then, the moral of the story is that if you crave chicken, go to KFC, not to the Bat Meat Shop.

            <h2 id="Fun">Fun facts about Arbor</h2>
            <p>
                ∎ In Arbor, it's customary for newlyweds to plant a sapling together as a symbol of their growing love and commitment. These "love trees" are often visited by couples on their anniversaries to mark the passage of time and the strength of their relationship.  
            </p>
            <p>
                ∎ Thanks to how tropical the island it and due to the beautiful ocean around the country, the national sport of Arbor is called "Rainforest Racing," where athletes navigate through a dense rainforest to the shore. There, they have to make a raft, boat, or anything that allows them to swim a kilometer off the shore to a finish line made from sea markers, also known as navigation buoys. This sport was created and internationally aired live and in TV shows as an appreciation for the wonderful nature of Arbor.  

 
            </p>
            <p>
                ∎ Another sport that is popular in Arbor is a tree climbing sport, where professional mountain climbers, and honestly any professional and trained climbers can take part in climbing the tall trees in the rainforests. This sport is also aired live for everyone to watch. Despite how dull and boring it may sound, it isn’t popular for no reason. It is often seen as exciting and thrilling sport to watch people climb these very tall trees at unbelievable speeds.  
            </p>
            <p>
                ∎ Arbor is often described as one of the cleanest countries in the world. There are many yearly cleaning events in the country, and the Arboreans have created some of the easiest, cheapest and creative ways to stay eco-friendly and not harm their beautiful country.  

 
            </p>
            <p>
                ∎ During the retreat of the British on the 4th of March 1828, that we previously talked about, there have been reported zero casualties. Why? Like we said previously, because it was a surprise attack, the British people boarded their ship and sailed off thanks to how quickly the British soldiers on guard during the night spotted the incoming Arboreans and managed to alert the others. However, one Arborean rebel went missing, and one of the British ships has later reported having one more worker than previously assumed. Now, the British had taken many prisoners and criminals from their country and taken them to Arbor to do labor, such as taking care of the cargo. But no one in the crew knew each and every single one of their prisoners, since they were just supposed to be cheap workers that no one cared about if they died. And so, it’s believed one of the Arboreans intentionally or accidentally had boarded the British ships during the surprise attack and hadn’t been found. The fate of the rebel that successfully blended in with the British is unknown.  
            </p>
            <p>
                ∎ The old currency of the Arboreans had been called “Leaflets”. They were supposed to represent the nature and fauna of Arbor. However, after making friendly contacts with Australia and other countries, they were replaced by the Australian dollar for convenience.  

 
            </p>
            <p>
                ∎ The national anthem of Arbor is quite unique. When the anthem was created during the time the Arboreans were colonized, they didn’t have very good or modern instruments such as pianos. Instead, they imitated the sounds of nature. Today, while singing the Arborian anthem the sounds of nature such as birds chirping, or the whistling of wind are still made to this day.   

 
            </p>
            <p>
                ∎ A tradition we didn’t talk about before is called “Forest bathing”. Now, the Arboreans don’t literally go into the local forest and take a bath in the pond they find. If you think about all the diseases you could get, that’s probably a bad idea. The people go there once a year, and spend some time there, “connecting” with the forest and nature.
